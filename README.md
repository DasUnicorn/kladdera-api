# kladdera-api

Kladerradatsch is redefining Task Management for Mental Well-being.
At its core, Kladerradatsch acknowledges the variability of human energy levels. Unlike traditional task managers that demand relentless productivity regardless of one's mental state, Kladerradatsch adapts to the user's fluctuating energy resources throughout the day.

Imagine a tool that empowers users to seize the high-energy days for tackling tasks and ambitions with fervor. Yet, equally important, Kladerradatsch gently reminds users to prioritize self-care and basic needs during low-energy periods, recognizing that productivity should never come at the cost of well-being.
